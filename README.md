# All-Matrix-Operations
This file contains all of the operations that can be made on a mtrix of any size (you can change the maxSize default = 10)
# declare Matrix 
you can declare a mtrix by using *declareMat()*
# string to Matrix
you can input the matrix as a string  [1.2 2.2 3.1; -4.5 5.4 6.3; 2.3 5.2 4.7] so it's converted into 2d dynamic array *stoMat()*
# print Matrix
printing the matrix ...duh!! *printMat()*
# multplying two matrices
*multMat()*
# finding the transpose of the matrix
using *transMat()*
# finding the detrminant
*detMat()*
# FINDING THE COFACTOR
*cofMat()*
# FINDING THE INVERSE
*InverseMat()*
# FINDING THE adjoint
*adjMat()*
